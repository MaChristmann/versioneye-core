Hey <%= @user.fullname %>,
<p>
  <!-- We're always hard at work to become the most awesome community for software developers. That's what we have done for you lately: -->
  It's quiet a while since we send out the last newsletter.
  In the last 2 months the daily traffic on VersionEye doubled!
  That caused some performance issues. We fixed that shortly by upgrading all our EC2 instances
  with more RAM and more CPUs. To be ready for even more traffic we did a
  big refactoring. VersionEye becomes more and more a distributed system. You can
  read more about that here on our
  <a href="http://blog.versioneye.com/2014/05/16/big-refactoring/">blog</a>
  if you are interested.
</p>
<p>
  And here are some additional features we released recently:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Maven Plugin:</b> Our <a href="https://github.com/versioneye/versioneye_maven_plugin/tree/master">Maven plugin</a>
    is available on Maven Central and on <a href="https://bintray.com/versioneye/versioneye/versioneye-maven-plugin/view/files/com/versioneye/versioneye-maven-plugin/2.0.1">Bintray</a>
    now. It is especially usefull for self hosted Java projects,
    Java projects with parent poms and reactor builds.
    <br/><br/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Gradle Plugin:</b> Simon Templer wrote a <a href="https://github.com/stempler/gradle-versioneye-plugin">Gradle plugin</a>
    for VersionEye. It works the same way as the Maven plugin and is available on Maven Central, too.
    <br/><br/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>References API:</b> VersionEye can show you how many other software packages are
    referencing a specific software package. We call that references. This is especially
    interesting if you are an open source developr and you want to see who else is using
    your project. Now we made this information available via our <a href="https://www.versioneye.com/api">API</a>. Read more that on
    our <a href="http://blog.versioneye.com/2014/05/06/new-api-endpoint-for-references/">blog</a>.
    <br/><br/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Dependency Graphs:</b> Now you can watch dependency graphs even for your
    private GitHub/Bitbucket repositories. Read more about this feature on our
    <a href="http://blog.versioneye.com/2014/05/16/dependency-graphs-for-private-projects/">blog</a>.
    <br/><br/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>New Dependency Badges:</b> We just updated all our dependency badges. Instead of delivering PNG files
    we deliver SVG now, generated by <a href="shields.io">shields.io</a>, an awesome service for badges.
    <br/><br/>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Turn on/off notifications:</b> If you follow software libraries on VersionEye you get email
    notifications as soon there are new versions available. The same information is available as RSS feed.
    If you are using our RSS feed you probably don't want to receive the emails. Now you can turn the
    email notifications on/off.
    Read more <a href="http://blog.versioneye.com/2014/05/14/turn-onoff-notification-emails/">here</a>.
    <br/><br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  And since we like continuous updating, we did many small improvements on the VersionEye page as well.
</p>
<p>
  We'd love to hear your feedback!
</p>

Your VersionEye Team<br/>
